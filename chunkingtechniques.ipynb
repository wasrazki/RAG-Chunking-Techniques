In Kubernetes, there is a master node and multiple worker nodes, each worker node can handle multiple pods. Pods are just a bunch of containers clustered together as a working unit. You can start designing your applications using pods. Once your pods are ready, you can specify pod definitions to the master node, and how many you want to deploy. From this point, Kubernetes is in control. It takes the pods and deploys them to the worker nods. If a worker node goes down, Kubernetes starts new pods on a functioning worker node. This makes the process of managing the containers easy and simple.\u001b[0m\n",

Scaling is an essential operational practice that used to be done manually for a long time concerning applications, with the introduction of tools like Kubernetes, the things have changed dramatically in the software industry. In the context of the Kubernetes cluster, there are typically two things you would like to scale as a user, Pods, and Nodes. There are three types of scaling: > HorizontalPodAutoscaler > VerticalPodAutoscaler, and > Cluster Autoscaler. With these techniques, Kubernetes can take intelligent scaling decisions automatically.

Cluster Autoscaler (CA) scales your node clusters based on the number of pending pods. It checks to see whether there are any pending pods and increases the size of the cluster so that these pods can be created. Mastering autoscaling needs some patience and persistent efforts to see which technique suits your app's needs by doing trial and error.

So within 18 months, Amadeus had lifted and shifted one of their most critical application 'Master Pricer' to the Google Cloud Platform. Now you know, the next step for them was to move to Kubernetes since it made more sense with Google Cloud Platform. The aim is, they wanted to go faster with Kubernetes, and the challenge was to add a disciplinary policy of learning Kubernetes across the team. So, the team at Amadeus started learning how to operate Kubernetes and how to monitor it, do alerting.During the migration, Amadeus had engineers from both Google and Red Hat on site to help them get to grips with OpenShift and the container orchestration technology Kubernetes.

Like Facebook & Microsoft, eBay is relying on open-sourcing to design their custom servers. Such an inspiring case study. Bloomberg is one of the first companies to adopt #Kubernetes . They used Kubernetes into production in 2017. The aim was to bring up new applications and services to users as fast as possible and free up developers from operational tasks. After evaluating many offerings from different firms, they selected Kubernetes as they thought it aligned exactly with what they were trying to solve. One of the key aims at Bloomberg was to make better use of existing hardware investments using different features of Kubernetes. As a result, they were able to very efficiently use the hardware tothe point where they could get close to 90 to 95 percent utilization rates (as per Andrey Rybka, head of the compute infrastructure team at Bloomberg) Nothing great comes easy; Kubernetes makes many things simpler only if you know how to use it. As the developers initially found it challenging to use, the teams had many training programs around Kubernetes at Bloomberg.

Minimum or restricting access to only specified and well-identified users who must perform defined actions on a resource is critical in securing your cluster and is one of the security best practices.

After evaluating many offerings from different firms, they selected Kubernetes as they thought it aligned exactly with what they were trying to solve. One of the key aims at Bloomberg was to make better use of existing hardware investments using different features of Kubernetes. As a result, they were able to very efficiently use the hardware tothe point where they could get close to 90 to 95 percent utilization rates (as per Andrey Rybka, head of the compute infrastructure team at Bloomberg) Nothing great comes easy; Kubernetes makes many things simpler only if you know how to use it.

It was transforming itself into a software company, unbelievable.Today the bank runs more than 3,000 applications.
