### ***Semantic Chunking Techniques in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)***
This repository explores various techniques for semantic chunking in the context of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Chunking refers to breaking down text into manageable and meaningful sections *based on their semantic content*, allowing for better information retrieval and processing in large documents. In this project, we demonstrate three semantic chunking techniques: *Statistical Chunking*, *Consecutive Chunking*, and *Cumulative Chunking*.
