# ***Semantic Chunking Techniques in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)***
This repository explores various techniques for semantic chunking in the context of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Chunking refers to breaking down text into manageable and meaningful sections *based on their semantic content*, allowing for better information retrieval and processing in large documents. In this project, we demonstrate three semantic chunking techniques: ***Statistical Chunking***, ***Consecutive Chunking***, and ***Cumulative Chunking***.

### ***What is Semantic Chunking?***

Semantic chunking refers to the process of dividing text into meaningful units based on the underlying semantic content rather than arbitrary factors like sentence length or structure. It helps in organizing information in a way that enhances understanding and retrieval.

For instance, if you have a research paper or technical documentation, semantic chunking allows you to break it down into sections where each chunk represents a coherent topic, making it easier to search and retrieve relevant information.

### ***Encoding the Content***
For encoding, we use the **HuggingFaceEncoder** from the semantic_router.encoders package, specifically the **"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2" model**. This model transforms the text into vector representations for semantic chunking.
