# ***Semantic Chunking Techniques in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)***
This repository explores various techniques for semantic chunking in the context of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Chunking refers to breaking down text into manageable and meaningful sections *based on their semantic content*, allowing for better information retrieval and processing in large documents. In this project, we demonstrate three semantic chunking techniques: ***Statistical Chunking***, ***Consecutive Chunking***, and ***Cumulative Chunking***.

### ***What is Semantic Chunking?***

Semantic chunking refers to the process of dividing text into meaningful units based on the underlying semantic content rather than arbitrary factors like sentence length or structure. It helps in organizing information in a way that enhances understanding and retrieval.

For instance, if you have a research paper or technical documentation, semantic chunking allows you to break it down into sections where each chunk represents a coherent topic, making it easier to search and retrieve relevant information.

### ***Encoding the Content***
For encoding, we use the **HuggingFaceEncoder** from the semantic_router.encoders package, specifically the **"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2" model**. This model transforms the text into vector representations for semantic chunking.

## ***Various Chunking Techniques***

### ***1.Statistical Chunking***
Statistical chunking automatically calculates the optimal threshold for chunking based on the similarity between different sections of text. This technique is ideal for documents where natural breaks in topics are important, as it dynamically identifies the points where the text should be split.


### ***2.Consecutive Chunking***
Consecutive chunking splits text into fixed-size chunks based on the number of tokens or words. While it's not semantically aware, it is fast and ideal for applications that require uniform chunk sizes.


### ***3.Cumulative Chunking***
Cumulative chunking creates progressively growing chunks by adding new content while preserving the previous context. This method is particularly useful when you want each new chunk to retain earlier information.
